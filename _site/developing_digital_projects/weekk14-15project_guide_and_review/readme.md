Weeks 14 and 15 -- Project Work

Through these two weeks students will create their final DH projects.

Students may pick any humanities topic of interest, identify a dataset that they then process using any of the DH tools we reviewed in class, and present the whole package online. To host their projects students create a website on a free platform (such as wix.com). As ever, students must be sure to include a section for Works Cited / Bibliography!
