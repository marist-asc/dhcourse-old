Welcome to “Digital Humanities: A Fifteen-Week Online Course,” where we will explore the relatively new field of digital humanities (“DH” for short), the nature of DH projects, how these spring out of traditional humanities work, a little bit about the history of the field, sample DH projects, plus an in-depth look at several free, easy-to-use “no code” DH tools that you will utilize to create your very own DH project.

Let’s get started! The following pages present our Course Outline.
