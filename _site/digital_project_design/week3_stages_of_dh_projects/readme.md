Stages of a DH Projects: Analysis and Publication

Once we have collected and readied our data for study, we can now begin to process it through different tools.

Each of these tools is free, easy-to-use, and requires no mastery of coding. We will explore each tool and appropriate uses in the following weeks. 

Juxtapose JS: Easy to make frame comparisons, https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/
Kumu: Make Sense of Your Messy World (networks), https://kumu.io/
Omeka Classic: Web Publishing Platform for Sharing Digital Collections and Creating Media Rich Online Exhibits,  https://omeka.org/classic/
Storymap JS: Maps that tell stories, https://storymap.knightlab.com/
Timeline JS: easy to make, beautiful timelines, https://timeline.knightlab.com/

Here we introduce a few useful, relatively simple tools to introduce students to the practice of choosing and employing DH tools for their own projects. 

Of course there exist numerous additional tools, some immensely complex, that allow humanists to study data sets. Well funded digital labs at universities can produce extremely complex DH projects that employ fleets of student workers to collect and input data for the lead faculty to analyze and interpret. 

One remarkable example of a DH project based on varied, layered data processed with  complex tools is Harvard University’s “Africamap”: https://worldmap.harvard.edu/africamap/ As you explore Africamap, think about the data required to create this massive project, and the teams of workers required to locate and collate it all!
