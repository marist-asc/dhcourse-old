Week 1 - What are Digital Humanities?

This week we introduce students to Digital Humanities (“DH” for short), where we consider the field of “traditional” humanities through definitions and examples, and begin to understand the concept of digital humanities.
 
Students explore a variety of both traditional and digital humanities projects, and investigate the National Endowment for the Humanities, the U.S. federal agency responsible for funding “research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities.”
